# FCC-Machine-Learning-with-python
## Context
My 5 Machine Learning projects that I've built as part of my freeCodeCamp assignments.
<br>
## Overview
The course notebooks and building these projects allowed me to familiarize myself with fundamental Machine Learning techniques.
I learned the specializations and applications of Machine Learning algorithms like regression, classification, and clustering.
## Certification
These projects also allowed me to obtain my <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification">freeCodeCamp Machine Learning Certification</a>.
