This course is designed as a one-semester college course. It consists of instructional videos, with Google Colaboratory notebooks to follow along interactively, assignments, and challenging projects.

This respository contains my solutions to the College Algebra with Python Certification projects. It provides a clear understanding of Algebra and how to write Python code to solve Algebra problems.

## Certification
These projects also allowed me to obtain my <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc5749a458-3e81-4be0-bc3b-2d349878c1bc/college-algebra-with-python-v8">College Algebra with Python Certification</a> which is a Developer Certification, representing approximately 300 hours of coursework.
